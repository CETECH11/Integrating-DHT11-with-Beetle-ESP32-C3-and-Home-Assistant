This project will allow you to monitor environmental conditions in your home automation setup. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. Components Required

Before we begin, gather the necessary components:

BeetleESP32C3 development board
DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
Jumper wires
USB cable for programming
A computer with the Arduino IDE or ESPHome installed

2. Flashing ESPHome to Beetle ESP32 C3
Install ESPHome on your computer. You can follow the instructions in my previous blog.
Create an ESPHome configuration file (e.g., dht11.yaml) with the following content:

```
sensor:
- platform: dht
pin: 0
model: dht11
temperature:
name: "Living Room Temperature"
humidity:
name: "Living Room Humidity"
update_interval: 5 s
```

Replace placeholders (YourWiFiSSID, YourWiFiPassword, etc.) with your actual values.
Compile and upload the configuration to your Beetle ESP32 C3 using the ESPHome CLI.

3. Integrating with Home Assistant
Open Home Assistant.
Click on Configuration (bottom left) and go to Integrations.
Click the + button and select ESPHome.
Enter the IP address of your ESP32 (leave the port as 6053) and click Finish.


5. Viewing Temperature and Humidity
Once integrated, Home Assistant will discover the Beetle ESP32 C3 module and create entities for temperature and humidity.
You can access these entities in Home Assistant‚Äôs dashboard and display them as cards or graphs.
And that‚Äôs it! You‚Äôve successfully integrated the DHT11 sensor with your Beetle ESP32 C3 and Home Assistant. Feel free to customize and expand this project based on your needs. Happy monitoring! üå°Ô∏èüíßüè†
